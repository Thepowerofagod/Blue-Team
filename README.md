## Network
- Secure Router
  - Disable WPS
  - Disable UPnp
  - Disable DMZ
  - Disable any Port Forwarding
  - Update Routerâ€™s Firmware
  - Use a complex WPA2 personal password whit CCMP(AES) or CBC-MAC algorithm
  - Use Not common network name (SSID)
  - Change routers login password
  - Enabling AP Isolation
  - Having separate Wi-Fi networks for devices of a different trust levels. SSID1, SSID2...

Keep IOT divices on separate fisical logical or wifi network
switches have what is called isolated collision domains which is a fancy way to say that you can sniff the traffic on the network with a switch because traffic only gets forwarded to the correct physical Lamport based on the mac address.
So the first thing to consider is having separate routable networks for different devices of different levels of trust. this could be implemented via your router, firewall, switch and wifi access point.
- 192.168.1.0/24
- 192.168.2.0/24
- 192.168.3.0/24
- 192.168.4.0/24
You could as an example in this connect this directly via a ethernet cable physically into your router and or firewall depending on what it is you're using and assign it its own network like we have here
VLAN:
Another option of these villans that you can see here villans virtual LANs. 1These are commonly used to isolate networks villans are the logical separation of networks instead of physical. And they use tags included in the packets that are sent between the devices on the network in order to determine that they are separate

Wi-Fi you will need a router and or access point that supports something called a ip isolation and it will need to support multiple SSIDs on the same access point.

## Application and Execution Control
All methods to preven the execution of malicious code on the endpoint. Things like Access Control ACLS, application white lists, anti executionsoftware AV or end point protection application controls, UAC, digital signatures, reputation systems, parental controls, software restriction policies and so on. Mostly use a form of application white listing to ensure the only specifically selected objects or programs and software libraries are executed. Use white listing on host and use a VM to be more dynamic.

## Sandboxing
- Windows 
- Mac
- Linux
- Use Firefox in custom VM whit Apparmor and Firejail (amnesic or roll back the snapshot)

## Firewall
Many firewalls are configured to simply drop incoming packets. Nmap sends a TCP SYN request, and receives nothing back. This indicates that the port is being protected by a firewall and thus the port is considered to be filtered.
That said, it is very easy to configure a firewall to respond with a RST TCP packet. For example, in IPtables for Linux, a simple version of the command would be as follows:
```
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport <port> -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
```
This can make it extremely difficult (if not impossible) to get an accurate reading of the target(s).

## Password Manager
If an attacker is present on your device using a key logger or other sort of malware, they will be able to capture the master password, which would compromise your database optimally. You would want to install this in a virtual machine to provide that extra layer of isolation or in cubes like as a separate VM to just give it that extra isolation. You may even steal the file on an encrypted USB or some other form of physical isolation.
